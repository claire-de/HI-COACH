LearnUs was introduced as the new Learning Management System (LMS) for Yonsei University as a substitute for YSCEC. However, there have been complaints that LearnUs does not provide a satisfactory LMS experience. This project tackled the problem of redesigning a mobile LearnUs interface to aid Yonsei University students in a cross-platform learning environment. </div>

                <p>LearnUs is a Learning Management System (LMS) developed as a substitute for YSCEC, the former LMS of Yonsei University. YSCEC was a supportive system for  face-to-face (F2F) lectures. However, since the strike of the global pandemic in 2020, the conventional classroom environment could no longer be considered as the first option for education due to the risk of mass infection. Therefore, the need for a service that fully supports the ‘untact’ lectures arose, and thus LearnUs was created. LearnUs succeeds most of the functions to YSCEC, and according to Yonsei Chunchu, the official university newsletter, LearnUs intends to target not only Yonsei University students but also both domestic and international students who need an online education platform. In addition, it also utilizes a cloud system, intended to make the use and share of data more efficient (Jeong, 2021). The main platform for LearnUs is PC, but also supports an adaptive interface to be used in mobile environments like tablets and smartphones.</p>
                <p>Although the adaptive interface makes LearnUs able to be used on a mobile platform, it was not specifically designed for mobile devices, thus making the mobile interface of the service rather like an adjunct for the PC environment, not fully accommodating the needs of the users who want to utilize this LMS in their mobile devices. Therefore, we plan to design a mobile application for LearnUs, to aid Yonsei University students in enhancing their cross-platform learning environment. Along the way, we also addressed some of the negative feedback that LearnUs has received and hope to fix them.</p>
                <p>The research has gone through the UI/UX critique of the current service, reviewed literature papers, and conducted a survey and interviews to gather information about the users’ experience with LearnUs. Then the results were organized and insights were drawn, partially using the Importance Performance Analysis (IPA). User characteristics, constraints, and implications were then inspected, leading to the description of functional requirements. Design goals were set and reflections were made based on our research, and were actualized into sketches and mockups. In the middle of our project process, the official LearnUs application was launched. Thus we took that into consideration when designing the high fidelity prototype. With our prototype, we conducted a user research, comparing it with the official LearnUs application  under various standards. Based on the reflections induced from the research, we revised the prototype design and noted some future resolutions to be made. </p>
