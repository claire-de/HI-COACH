The voice of discontent against the new system was so loud among Yonsei students that the school newspaper covered the issues surrounding LearnUs. The problems ranged from technological problems including server issues to poor design leading to complex navigation and inconvenience. Most importantly, a mobile application for LearnUs did not exist, meaning that students had to access the website through Safari every time with their mobile device. </p>

                    <p>A survey was conducted on Yonsei University students who have experienced the LearnUs platform to gain general information about the user experience. Questions were asked to measure usage frequency, satisfaction level on each device, and importance and satisfaction level of each function. There were a total of 345 responses, and the findings from analyzing the results are as below.</p>
                    <p>i. Users are dissatisfied with the current mobile LearnUs environment.</p>
                    <p>More than half of respondents found PC LearnUs to be unsatisfactory, and even a higher number found mobile LearnUs to be unsatisfactory. Through this question, we could verify once more that LearnUs was not providing a satisfactory mobile LMS experience and was in need of improvement.</p>

                    <p>ii. Users tend to be more dissatisfied with more important tasks</p>
                    <p>It can be found from the IPA(Importance Performance Analysis) Chart below that the functions of higher importance tended to have lower satisfaction levels. Especially, notification, watching lectures, assignment turn-in, and calendar functions had significantly low satisfaction levels even though they scored high in importance. Measuring importance and satisfaction of each function let us set our priorities in establishing design goals for a redesigned interface.</p>

                    <p>Subsequently, interviews were conducted with eight students with different usage patterns. In terms of method, interviews were first asked to fill out the survey questionnaire above and explain the reason behind their responses. Then, daily studying patterns and assignment tracking patterns were asked to be described. After that, interviewees were asked to perform the main functions of LearnUs while describing their thoughts and process by thinking out loud. Through in-depth interviews, we could gain valuable insight on how students use LearnUs within their daily life and what makes them dissatisfied.</p>
                    <p>i. Users assign a specific use for each device</p>
                    <p>Computers were mostly used for assignment submission and watching lectures. On the other hand, phones and tablets were used for supplementary uses, such as checking notifications and notetaking.</p>

                <div class ="iteration-content">From these insights, we devised the first design solution, which is interface design for supplementary services. We kept only the notification and assignment-tracking functions (to-do, calendar) and removed all other functions. Our goal was to keep the application light and focus on the role of the mobile application as a supplementary learning tool.</div>

                    <p>Our team conducted moderated usability tests on 8 participants with our prototype. The participants were selected to be representative of our target users, all of them being Yonsei University students.</p>
                    <p>To compare the current official LearnUs application and our prototype we asked the users to do the testing on both types. The testing sessions were consisted of two parts: think aloud testing with five representative tasks, and post-test SUS survey and interviews.</p>

                    <p>Users showed an improvement in the task completion rate compared to the LearnUs app. The average SUS score for our prototype was significantly higher than that of LearnUs, indicating an improvement in design and a need for only minor modifications.</p>

                    <p>Overall, the participants preferred the redesigned version more than the original LearnUs application, saying that it is more straightforward and convenient, with added functions.</p>
                    <p>Since LearnUs is a relatively new system, they kept on updating even in the middle of our research. We felt that it was hard to work with a contemporary issue.</p>
                    <p>The teamwork as a group was great. We had fruitful and efficient discussions and all of the members were always willing to help each other out when needed, thus lessening the burden.</p>
                    <p>As a designer, I found it very meaningful to go through the whole design process. I believe this project was a stepping stone to acquiring the core skills as a UX designer.</p>
